            1. The Heritage Archives project was established by interested
            alumni, staff, faculty, and students of Rocky Mountain College to
            acquire, preserve, and illustrate the history and development of
            Rocky Mountain College, Billings Polytechnic Institute,
            Intermountain Union College, Montana Wesleyan College, the College
            of Montana, and Montana Collegiate Institute.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            All title for gifts to the Archives are conveyed to the Heritage
            Archives.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Archives collections are comprised of materials whose primary
            purpose is for research by alumni, students, and the public.
            Acceptable material will generally relate to documentation of the
            history of Rocky Mountain College and will include manuscripts,
            records, photographic materials, pamphlets and programs, school
            related publications, publications of alumni yearbooks, and records
            of organizations and offices on campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Literary rights: Unless otherwise restricted by copyright or by the
            donor and agreed to, in writing, by the archives representative at
            the time of acquisition, all literary rights are conveyed to the
            Heritage Archives of Rocky Mountain College. The archives can assume
            no responsibility for misuse of literary or copyright restrictions
            by users of unrestricted material beyond normal professional ethics
            and standards. Material placed in the archives is primarily for
            research and, unless restricted, will be used for that purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Archives material may on occasion be used in the library, other
            educational programs, and public or personal review. All use is
            subject to authorization.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Gifts to the archives are considered outright and unrestricted
            donations to be used in the best interests of the Heritage Archives.
            Usually, accepted gifts are considered extremely important or the
            best available at the time acquired. However, no individual or
            institution can predict nor govern the changing attitudes of future
            generations, nor guarantee permanency beyond the best available
            preservation procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is sometimes impractical to evaluate all material at the time of
            acquisition. Upon evaluation, some material may be declared
            expendable. In addition, certain material already in existing
            collections may become expendable by acquisition of better examples.
            Expendable material includes surplus, duplicate, non-relevant, or
            material of deteriorated condition or limited use. Such material
            will be used in the best interests of the archives and the College,
            including, but not limited to, sale and exchange programs to acquire
            other needed materials, loans to schools and other institutions, and
            disposal if the condition or value so warrants. Any material
            declared expendable must be approved by the archives representative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain items within the donation may be immediately determined to
            not be adaptable to the archives collections and policies. Reasons
            for such determination would include: duplication, lack of space and
            facilities, or failure to fit the archives areas of acquisition.
            Those items so deemed (if any) are listed on a separate sheet
            attached to the back of the receipt. The donor is asked to advise
            the archives concerning disposition of such items.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Heritage Archives cannot appraise donations for tax purposes. For
            the protection of the donor, it is recommended that such appraisals
            be done by a qualified disinterested third party.
          </p>
          <h2>Regulations for Use of Archives</h2>
          <p>
            1. The archive collections and materials are not for circulation.
            (Exceptions for taking materials out of the archives for specific
            purposes may be authorized by a committee member only.)
          </p>
          <p>
            2. All patrons will be required to sign a "Research Materials
            Request" before they are permitted to use any archival materials.
            This form will be signed by a member of the committee before
            materials are used.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. All reproduction (photocopying, microfilming, or any other
            reproduction) will be done with committee authorization at patron's
            expense.
          </p>
          <p>4. There is to be no ink used when working in the archives.</p>
          <p>
            5. Restricted materials usage by patrons will be in accordance with
            the specific restrictions placed on the items. Restrictions are
            located at the front of the collection. If there are any doubts
            about restrictions, a committee member must be consulted.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. The value and life of archives materials must be preserved with
            special care by the patron handling manuscripts with care, always
            keeping them in order, being careful not to mark them, having clean
            hands, and taking care not to lean on the documents.
          </p>
          <p>7. Tape should not be used on archival material.</p>
          <p>
            8. Patrons will not be permitted to use the oral history tapes â€“
            summaries or transcripts are available.
          </p>
          <p>9. Smoking is prohibited in the archive research area.</p>
          <p>
            10. Researchers assume full responsibility for conforming to the
            laws of libel and literary property rights that may be involved in
            the use of any document preserved in the archives collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            11. The Heritage Archives Committee reserves the right to refuse the
            use of any material and may at any time prohibit the further use of
            a collection by a research worker. Any and all questions regarding
            the archives policy or procedures should be directed to the Heritage
            Archives Committee.
          </p>
          <p>
            These rules and regulations are not intended to place a burden on
            the researcher, but instead to protect and preserve the materials
            for continued use and enjoyment of all Rocky Mountain College
            patrons in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            The records of Rocky Mountain College* emanate from many sources.
            The Archives must rely on the cooperation and support of the
            administration, deans, directors, faculty, students, and alumni to
            ensure that material of historical value is collected and preserved.
            The Heritage Archives may collect material in the following
            categories from administrative and academic units of the College.

            (correspondence, reports, and subject files) should be inactive and
            no longer of use in the activities of the originating office. They
            should be forwarded to the archives according to a schedule agreed
            upon by the archives staff and the office of origin. A
            representative of the archives will consult with the various offices
            to arrange for orderly transfer of non-current material destined for
            the archives. When material is forwarded it should be accompanied by
            an inventory describing the records being transferred. The
            originating office may wish to place restrictions on access to
            non-current records.
          </p>
          <p>
            II. PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL PAPERS OF ROCKY MOUNTAIN COLLEGE
            FACULTY
          </p>
          <p>
            As an important part of its mission of documenting the internal life
            of the Rocky Mountain College community, the Heritage Archives
            actively seeks to acquire, organize, and make available the personal
            and professional papers of the Rocky Mountain College faculty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Faculty papers offer insight into the history and operation of the
            College that otherwise may be lost by relying only on official
            administrative records. They reveal professional interests and
            opinions that frequently clarify matters mentioned in the official
            records of the central administration. Faculty papers document the
            academic life of the College and relate one's academic career to his
            or her total interests, thereby constituting an important historical
            record. Personal viewpoints expressed in private correspondence and
            documentation resulting from service on academic committees provide
            a better basis for understanding the offices. Without a broad range
            of faculty papers the formal official accounts of the College are
            often misleading.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following reflects the types of documentation sought by the
            Heritage Archives:
          </p>
          <p>1. Correspondence</p>
          <p>
            a. Official: outgoing (copies and drafts) and incoming
            correspondence and memoranda generated in the course of conducting
            College business.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. Professional: outgoing and incoming correspondence relating to
            all facets of one's academic career, colleagues, publishers,
            professional societies, students, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            c. Personal: letters to/from friends, relatives, acquaintances,
            business correspondence, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Biographical material: resumes, vita sheets, bibliographical
            sketches, chronologies, genealogies, newspaper clippings, personal
            memoirs, etc.
          </p>
          <p>3. Photographs: prints, slides, negatives</p>
          <p>4. Tape recordings: lectures, speeches, discussions, etc.</p>
          <p>5. Class lecture notes and syllabi.</p>
          <p>6. Research files.</p>
          <p>7. Departmental or committee minutes and records.</p>
          <p>
            *Rocky Mountain College refers to Rocky Mountain College and its
